# CS210_data_science_project
CS 210 Sabanci University Group Project - Spring 19/20.
In this project, we explore Airbnb and New York City related data and try to find correlations to reveal the main features that might have an effect on customers' decisions when they rent a house from Airbnb. By using these features and properties of listings we are going to try to predict listing prices.
